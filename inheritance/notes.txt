OOP - CONSTRUCTORS:

- When a class is instantiated, a constructor is created implicitly.
- Constructor has no return type.
- Constructor overloading :
-- similar to method overloading  you can
   + define two constructors and based on the signature java will know which one to call
   + we can use constructor overloading to pass default values

-- if the nbr of parameters is the same between two constructors:
    the types of the parameters or order must defer

- Constructors chaining:
    + allows to call a constructor form inside another constructor
-- usage:
---- could be used to provide default values by declaring a constructor that takes no
     argument and call the other constructor that requires arguments and pass default values manually
