OOP - CONSTRUCTORS:

- When a class is instantiated, a constructor is created implicitly.
- Constructor has no return type.
- Constructor overloading :
-- similar to method overloading  you can
   + define two constructors and based on the signature java will know which one to call
   + we can use constructor overloading to pass default values

-- if the nbr of parameters is the same between two constructors:
    the types of the parameters or order must defer

- Constructors chaining:
    + allows to call a constructor form inside another constructor
-- usage:
---- could be used to provide default values by declaring a constructor that takes no
     argument and call the other constructor that requires arguments and pass default values manually

-POJO: Plain Old Java Object -> see Pojo.java
    + a POJO class is a class that doesn't extend any other classes
    + doesn't include complex logic
    + Encapsulation
    + No annotations: annotations looks like decorators, but they dont affect code execution directly they can instruct code execution in a particular manner , they provide data about the function or a class.
