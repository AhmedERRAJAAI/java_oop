#INHERITANCE:
- Extends:
    Using extends specifies the superclass (or the parent class) of the we're declaring
        + we can say Dog is subclass of Animal
        + we can say Animal is super class of Dog
        + a class can extend only one class

- super()
    it's a way to call a constructor on the super class directly from the sub class's constructor.

- overriding a method
   + Overriding a method is when you create a method on a subclass that has the same method signature as a method on a super class.
   + you override a parent class method when you want the child class to show different behaviour for that method
