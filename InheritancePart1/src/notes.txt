#INHERITANCE:
- Extends:
    Using extends specifies the superclass (or the parent class) of the we're declaring
        + we can say Dog is subclass of Animal
        + we can say Animal is super class of Dog
        + a class can extend only one class

- super()
    it's a way to call a constructor on the super class directly from the sub class's constructor.
